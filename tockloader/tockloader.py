	# Tockloader includes built-in settings for known Tock boards to make the
	# overall user experience easier. As new boards support Tock, board-specific
	# options can be include in the Tockloader source to make it easier for
	# users.
	#
	# There are two levels of board-specific configurations: communication
	# details and application details.
	#
	# - Communication details: These are specifics about how Tockloader should
	#   communicate with the board and what specific commands are needed to
	#   program the device.
	#
	# - Application details: These are specifics about how applications should
	#   be situated in flash for a particular board. For instance, MPU rules may
	#   dictate where an application can be placed to properly protect its
	#   memory.
	#
	# Here, we set the application details that are board specific. See
	# `board_interface.py` for the board-specific communication details.
	#
	# Options
	# -------
	# - `order`:           How apps should be sorted when flashed onto the board.
	#                      Supported values: size_descending
	# - `size_constraint`: Valid sizes for the entire application.
	#                      Supported values: powers_of_two, none
	# - `size_minimum`:    Minimum valid size for each application. This size is
	#                      the entire size of the application. In bytes.
